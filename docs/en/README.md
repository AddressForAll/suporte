## A4A Support Documentation

## Context and presentation

The [git.addressForAll.org/suporte](http://git.addressForAll.org/suporte) is a [`git` repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)
with rules, datasets (including data about "support tickets"), for the management and transparency of the Technical Support Team of the AddressForAll Institute.
<!--
The Support Team exists in the context of the AddressForAll Institute, but not all of the team members are permanently active or institutional members.
The "support tikets" help to manage the demands as well as the Team, which performs a series of small calls and small services,
which need to be registered in a transparent way - all accountability, all doubts, doubts and welcome from the community are carried out publicly.
-->

In the `git` repository, rules, datasets and support tickets are registered, so, this documentation is about registration process and support other
general support rules.
Some rules are about tools recommendation, for example "visualize data with QGIS" recommendation, so, we also offer some support documentation for tools.
